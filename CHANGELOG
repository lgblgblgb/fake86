Fake86 changelog for v0.12.9.19

v0.12.9.19:
  - Fixed bug from v0.12.9.16 where the call to createscalemap() in the
    VideoThread() function was placed before the mutex lock, sometimes causing
    crashes when Fake86 first loads. (due to an uninitialized pointer)

  - Fixed bug in imagegen that made it crash on some Windows systems.


v0.12.9.16:
  - Fixed bug from v0.12.9.12 that caused faulty CPU emulation on big-endian
    host CPUs, such as the PowerPC.

  - Fixed another bug from v0.12.9.12 that caused colors to be incorrect on
    big-endian host CPUs.

  - Added "-slowsys" command line option that can be used to fix audio dropout
    issues on very slow host CPUs by decreasing audio generation quality.

  - Added another stretching function that is used when the SDL window is
    exactly double of the width and height of the emulated video. Only active
    when no smoothing method has been specified. This saves the CPU a lot of
    work since we now only need to calculate the color to draw once for every
    four pixels, instead of recalculating the same color for every pixel
    This makes difference between smooth video and jerky, useless video on
    very old systems such as my 400 MHz PowerPC G3 iMac.

  - Added an obvious speed tweak which I should have had all along by
    generating a "scale map" lookup table once on every screen mode change.
    we no longer need to make expensive floating point scale calculations on
    every pixel in every frame. The speed boost is very noticeable on slower
    machines such as those with a Pentium 4 or older CPU.

  - No longer distributing IBM's ROM BASIC bundled with Fake86 out of legal
    concern. Is it very old? Yes. Does IBM care? Likely not, but they still
    hold the copyright. You can still use ROM BASIC by providing your own ROM
    dump. It should be 32,768 bytes in size, and must be named "rombasic.bin"
    without the quotes. After building and installing Fake86, you need to put
    the ROM dump in "/usr/share/fake86/" unless you explicitly changed the
    path in the makefile. In the case of running under Windows, the file
    should be placed in the same directory as the executable.

  - Created and included a new makefile, this one customized to work in
    Haiku OS. More information about Haiku at their website:

v0.12.9.12:
  - Around 80% of this version is a rewrite compared to all older versions of
    v0.11.7.22 and prior, and I am considering it a "fresh start". Older
    releases will no longer be officially available, and are to be considered
    obsolete. This fresh code base has far too many bugfixes, tweaks, design,
    layout, and speed improvements to even bother putting together a list of
    changes.
